WARNING - USE WITH CAUTION

This folder contains backups that are automatically generated from the Project's Venue.bin file when saving the Project.

If you find that your Project's Venue.bin file has been corrupted somehow, these files exist as a possible means to recover some of your previous work.

The files have been named using the Date & Time when they were saved.
To revert to a previous version:
  - Exit RTB
  - Delete (or rename) the existing [YourProject]\Venue.bin.
  - Copy the selected file into the parent folder and rename it to Venue.bin.

NOTE
If these older files contain references to XPack/Textures that are no longer present, they may not load.
